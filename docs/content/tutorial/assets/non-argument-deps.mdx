# Assets without Arguments and Return Values

So far, all the assets we’ve looked at are straightforward to work with as Python objects in memory - e.g. `nabisco_cereals` is created by constructing a list of row objects and then storing that list in a file.

However, often we don’t want to build or load our assets as Python objects in memory. For example, we might compute an asset by copying a file, by issuing a `create table` statement to a database, or by executing a command-line utility.

In those situations, we can define assets whose functions don't have return values or arguments. And we can mix those assets with assets that do have return values or arguments.

## Bringing in cereal ratings

We'd like to augment our cereal assets with a dataset of cereal ratings from a consumer reporting organization. We've found a separate data source with this information, and it lives in a zip file that we can download from the internet. We'd like to use it to compute three assets:

- `cereal_ratings_zip` - A zip file on our local filesystem, which contains the cereal ratings.
- `cereal_ratings_csv` - A CSV file on our local filesystem, which contains the unzipped contents of `cereal_ratings_zip`.
- `nabisco_cereal_ratings` - A pickle file containing the cereal ratings data from `cereal_ratings_csv` joined with the cereals in our `nabisco_cereals` asset.

### A zip file of cereal ratings from the internet

Let's start with `cereal_ratings_zip`. We'll add this to the same Python source file we used to store the complex asset graph in the previous section:

```python file=/guides/dagster/asset_tutorial/non_argument_deps.py startafter=cereal_ratings_zip_start endbefore=cereal_ratings_zip_end function=cereal_ratings_zip_assets dagimage=images/asset-screenshots/guides/dagster/asset_tutorial/non_argument_deps/cereal_ratings_zip_assets.svg
import urllib.request


@asset
def cereal_ratings_zip() -> None:
    urllib.request.urlretrieve(
        "https://dagster-git-tutorial-nothing-elementl.vercel.app/assets/cereal-ratings.csv.zip",
        "cereal-ratings.csv.zip",
    )
```

The implementation downloads a zip file from the internet to our local filesystem. It looks a lot like the assets we defined earlier in this tutorial, with two differences:

- **It doesn't have a return statement.** Instead of returning an object and letting the I/O manager write it to storage, the function handles writing to storage itself.
- **It has a `None` annotation for its return type.** This helps Dagster understand what we already know by looking at it - that the function never returns any values.

### An unzipped CSV of cereal ratings

Let's define an asset that contains the unzipped contents of our zip file:

```python file=/guides/dagster/asset_tutorial/non_argument_deps.py startafter=cereal_ratings_csv_start endbefore=cereal_ratings_csv_end function=cereal_ratings_csv_assets dagimage=images/asset-screenshots/guides/dagster/asset_tutorial/non_argument_deps/cereal_ratings_csv_assets.svg
import zipfile


@asset(non_argument_deps={"cereal_ratings_zip"})
def cereal_ratings_csv() -> None:
    with zipfile.ZipFile("cereal-ratings.csv.zip", "r") as zip_ref:
        zip_ref.extractall(".")
```

The implementation extracts our zip file to a CSV file in the same directory. It looks a lot like the assets we defined earlier in this tutorial, with one main difference.

In the assets we've seen so far, we indicate the asset dependencies by including function arguments with the name of the upstream assets. Dagster then invokes an I/O manager to load the asset as a Python object and supply it to our function.

However, in this case, we don't want a Python object for the upstream asset, we just want to work with the file directly. So we instead supply `"cereal_ratings_zip"` to the `non_argument_deps` parameter of the `@asset` decorator. This lets us tell Dagster that the `cereal_ratings_csv` asset depends on the `cereal_ratings_zip` asset, without telling it to load `cereal_ratings_zip` for us.

### Nabisco cereal ratings

Finally, let's define an asset that joins the cereal ratings data from `cereal_ratings_csv` with the cereals in our `nabisco_cereals` asset:

```python file=/guides/dagster/asset_tutorial/non_argument_deps.py startafter=nabisco_cereal_ratings_start endbefore=nabisco_cereal_ratings_end function=nabisco_cereal_ratings_assets dagimage=images/asset-screenshots/guides/dagster/asset_tutorial/non_argument_deps/nabisco_cereal_ratings_assets.svg
@asset(non_argument_deps={"cereal_ratings_csv"})
def nabisco_cereal_ratings(nabisco_cereals):
    with open("cereal-ratings.csv", "r") as f:
        cereal_ratings = {
            row["name"]: row["rating"] for row in csv.DictReader(f.readlines())
        }

    result = {}
    for nabisco_cereal in nabisco_cereals:
        name = nabisco_cereal["name"]
        result[name] = cereal_ratings[name]

    return result
```

This asset mixes and matches argument-based dependencies with non-argument-based dependencies. It depends on the `nabisco_cereals` asset, which we defined in the previous section of the tutorial, and it relies on Dagster to load that asset's value into memory. It also depends on the `cereal_ratings_csv` asset, and the decorated function takes responsibility for loading that asset's value into memory.

Now let's visualize all these assets in Dagit:

```bash
dagit -f complex_asset_graph.py
```

Navigate to <http://127.0.0.1:3000>:

## When to use assets without arguments and return values

In prior sections, we saw assets with return values and arguments — where business logic and I/O are kept separate. In this section, we saw assets with no return values and no arguments — where there's no separation between business logic and I/O. When should you use one instead of the other?

In general, doing the former is preferred - to use return values and arguments in the `@asset`-decorated function and to keep any custom I/O code inside an [I/O manager](/concepts/io-management/io-managers). A couple of the reasons are:

- Separating business logic from I/O makes it easier to write lightweight tests for the business logic.
- There are fewer opportunities for bugs. In the implementation of `cereal_ratings_csv`, it would be easy to accidentally read from the wrong file.

However, sometimes this is impossible or inconvenient. When you're working with tools that aren't designed for a clean separation between business logic and I/O, it's often not worth going through contortions to fit them into the argument/return model. For those cases, use the patterns shown in this section.
